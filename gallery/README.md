# Simple Photo Gallery

Create beautiful photo galleries from collections in just 30 seconds. No configuration required to get started‚Äîsimply run two commands in your photos folder and create a static gallery website you can self-host.

This is a free, open-source tool that you can use to generate galleries and self-host them. If you don't want to use the command line or bother with self-hostting, please check out [simple.photo](https://simple.photo) for a hosted solution.

```

1. Install the [simple-photo-gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-photo-gallery) package from NPM (if you don't already have it)
2. Prompt you for your gallery title, description, and header image
3. Scan your photos and create a `gallery.json` file
4. Generate optimized thumbnails
5. Build a static HTML gallery that you can open in your browser and self-host

## Telemetry

Simple Photo Gallery collects optional anonymised usage telemetry to help us understand which features are the most helpful and to prioritise improvements. No personal data or information about your photos is collected. You need to opt-in the first time you use a command for telemetry to be collected. When the CI or DO_NOT_TRACK environment variables are set, telemetry is disabled.

You can manage telemetry at any time:

```bash
spg telemetry -s 0   # opt out of telemetry
spg telemetry -s 1   # opt back in
```

Every command also accepts `--telemetry 0` or `--telemetry 1` to temporarily override your global preference.

## Python Version

The old Python version of Simple Photo Gallery V1 is still available [here](https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery), but is now deprecated.
