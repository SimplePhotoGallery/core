# Simple Photo Gallery

Create beautiful photo galleries from collections in just 30 seconds. No configuration required to get started‚Äîsimply run two commands in your photos folder and create a static gallery website you can self-host.

This is a free, open-source tool that you can use to generate galleries and self-host them. If you don't want to use the command line or bother with self-hostting, please check out [simple.photo](https://simple.photo) for a hosted solution.

This will:

1. Prompt you for your gallery title, description, and header image
